## **Topic :**
### _Stocks price forecasting using sequential deep learning  models & development of profitable portfolios for intra day traders using statistical optimization techniques._



- For stock forecasting historical stock datasets was used & then the data was pre-processed using Exploratory Data Analysis **(EDA)**, feature engineering etc. before training our models.

- For portfolio construction we used the Markowitz's Modern Portfolio Theory **(MPT)** & then optimized it using statistical optimization processes like Particle Swarm Optimization **(PSO)** etc.
